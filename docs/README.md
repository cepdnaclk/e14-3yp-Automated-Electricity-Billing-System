## Introduction

    In present world embedded systems have become essential as every electronic and 
    electrical day to day devices use the particular system for it's functionality.
    Here our target is to achieve an automated and centralized electricity billing system with more security and efficiency.

Functionalities of the new system
    
    * Accurate meter reading
    * Can get update about the connection frequently
    * Digital display for customers
    * Customer can identify the trend of usage of the electricity



## Solution Architecture

    CO321    -    It's planned to implement a new device to measure the current,
                  to transmit the data to the regional office and to display the certain facts to the customer using embedded systems.
    CO324    -    Data is to be transmitted to the regional office and from regional units then to a centralized server.
    CO325    -    Data has to be secured as a third party or the customer may try to alter. Device also has to be secured.

## Hardware and Software Designs
